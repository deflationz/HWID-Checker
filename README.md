# Virus Check

As you guys know I provide a virus check in most of my projects. I use [virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload), the results are 8/67, see more [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/641b81495763d0531d2e1ae226416c0b975fda0dce9d2142af14da31feee4382?nocache=1).

# Libraries
